**Employee_Salary_Prediction**
**ML Workflow using Google Colab & Streamlit**
  This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks that demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing to deploying a Streamlit web application for predicting employee salaries.

**Contents**
**Notebook 1: Employee_Salary_Models_Comp.ipynb**
This notebook covers the full machine learning pipeline:
**Data Preprocessing:**
  Handling missing values
  Encoding categorical variables
**Outlier Detection and Removal:**
  Techniques like Z-score and IQR
**Feature Scaling:**
  Standardization and Normalization
**Model Comparison:**
  Train and evaluate multiple ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  Compare model performance using visualizations
**Model Saving:**
  Export the best-performing model using joblib or pickle

**Notebook 2: Employee_Salary_Models_Final.ipynb**
This notebook focuses on deployment using Streamlit:
**Load the Saved Model:**
  Import the trained model from Notebook 1
**Build Web Application:**
  Create a user-friendly app.py interface using Streamlit
  Accept user inputs for prediction
  Display real-time predictions
**Run the App:**
  Locally using:
    streamlit run app.py
  Deploy using platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud
  
**Technologies Used:**
  Python 3.x
  Google Colab
  Scikit-learn
  XGBoost
  Pandas, NumPy
  Seaborn, Matplotlib
  Streamlit
  Joblib / Pickle

**Future Work:**
**Salary Growth Recommendations:**
  Enhance the system to not only predict current salaries but also suggest actionable steps for career growth.
This could include recommending relevant skills, certifications, training programs, or job transitions that could lead to higher salary prospects. These insights can help employees and job seekers make more informed career decisions.
**Integration of Advanced Algorithms:**
  Expand the model’s capabilities by incorporating more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks or ensemble hybrid models.
These can help capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data and improve prediction accuracy, especially in diverse job markets.
**Interactive and Personalized User Experience:**
  Build a more interactive platform that allows users to explore “what-if” scenarios—like changing their job title, location, or qualifications—to see how it would affect their salary.
  Integrate features like:
    Personalized career guidance
    Salary benchmarking tools
    Market trend analysis for better decision-making
**Real-Time Data and Market Trends:**
  Connect the system to real-time labor market data APIs to ensure salary predictions stay aligned with current industry standards.
  This would enhance prediction accuracy and keep the model relevant as job markets evolve.
**Enterprise-Level Integration:**
  Develop APIs or dashboards that organizations can embed into their HR systems to support:
    Internal salary analysis
    Workforce planning
    Transparent compensation practices
